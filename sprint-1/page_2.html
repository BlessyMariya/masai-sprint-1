    <li style="color:crimson"> It's a tool that has enough power, when used properly (and very often improperly) to kill.</li>
    <li style="color:crimson"> Hunting rifles and shotguns are for killing animals.</li>
    <li style="color:crimson"> Handguns–if we’re being honest–are for killing people. That’s the purpose behind their design–they are portable, concealable, easy-to-use tools for killing a person. </li>
