    <h2>There have certain rules and regulations to follow while using guns</h2> 
    <ul>
<li> No ordinary Indian citizen can acquire a gun without obtaining a license from the competent licensing authority. The amended Arms Rules of 2016, make acquiring a license necessary even for airguns.</li>
</ul>
<h3> How can a citizen apply to  get a gun?</h3>
   <ul>
       <li style="float:left"> Any ordinary citizen in India cannot just go to a shop and buy a gun. </li>
       <li style="float:left">The strict draconian laws in India on arms control have made it nearly impossible for an ordinary citizen to own a gun. </li>
       <li>Nevertheless, the procedure for acquiring a gun is laid down clearly by the Arms Act, 1959 under Chapter III</li>
       <li style="float:left"> First and foremost, to own a gun in India, a civilian needs to be minimum 21 years of age.</li>
      <li style="float:left"> An application form needs to be filled by the applicant which asks about his or her past criminal behaviour.</li>
       <li style="float:left">Guns are for only three purposes: crop protection, sport and self defence. For a self- defence license, a civilian has to prove imminent threat to life.</li>
       <li style="float:left">Protection can also be from wild animals.</li>
    </ul>
